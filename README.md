# Difference-in-Differences Analysis with Survey Data

## Overview
Difference-in-differences (DiD) approach with the underlying counterfactual parallel trends assumption is one of the most widely used approaches for policy effect evaluation. However, traditional DiD methods may not be directly applicable in the absence of population-level panel data, particularly when the target population could substantially differ from the treated units observed during the post-intervention period. In this work, we focus on addressing the following two
challenges in using DiD methods with repeated cross-sectional (RCS) survey data: (1) the heterogeneous compositions of study samples across different time points, and (2) the availability of only a subset
of the population. We formally introduce the policy-relevant target estimand and establish its identification conditions. We propose a new weighting approach that incorporates both estimated propensity scores and survey weights. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed method and examine its finite sample performance through simulations. Finally, we apply our proposed method to a real-world data application, estimating the effect of a beverage tax on adolescent soda consumption in Philadelphia.
